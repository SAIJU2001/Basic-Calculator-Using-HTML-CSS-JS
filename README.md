# Description
A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. Basic calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division mathematical calculations.
The most basic calculator is the four-function calculator, which can perform basic arithmetic such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
These are sometimes called pocket calculators or hand-held electronic calculators because they are small enough to fit in a shirt pocket. They are also the least expensive calculator, costing around $5 or less.
Four-function calculators usually have a +, -, x and / sign to denote the operations and can produce decimal numbers. Some also have a % button, which is used to calculate percentages.
